### Installing CLI

Installed AWS CLI on Gitpod. 

Added credentials and ran the `aws sts get-caller-identity` command and it was working. 

Added the task script in the .yaml file. 

Next day I tried to start the environment and it wouldn't recognise my region no matter what I tried. 

I tried resetting the env vars by taking the keys etc out of the quotation marks. 

I tried `unset AWS_...` for each variable. 

Nothing. 

I tried `or var in AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY AWS_DEFAULT_REGION AWS_REGION; do eval unset $var ; done`. 

Nothing. 

Each time I took the credentials off, fine but as soon as I added them back it would return error messages 

So I tried deleting the environment but the tasks script were still there. 

Cut an extremely long story short, I deleted everything github repository and everything and started again. 

Decided that as I have already got CLI on my macbook, I will add AWS CLI on my new windows laptop.

I followed the AWS document to [install AWS CLI on Windows]() and ran the `msiexec` command:

`
    msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi
`
Checked the version by running `aws --version`

Ran `aws configure`

### Create an Admin User

Created a new user because my user created prior to the bootcamp had admin access which is not good for security. Created a group and added an Admin policy to the group:
